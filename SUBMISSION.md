# Submission

## Overview

First, I focused on **structuring the layout** to improve usability and clarity.

Next, I implemented **additional filters** to refine search results. These included **price range, passenger count, brand, and type**. To enhance user-friendliness, I also renamed **Classification** to **Type**, making it more intuitive for users.

Following this, I improved the **vehicle listing** by adding a **thumbnail** for each car and displaying more details such as **model, year, type, passenger capacity, hourly price, and estimated total price**. Additionally, I ensured that the entire card is **clickable** on mobile for a better user experience.

I then introduced **sorting options**, allowing users to sort vehicles by **price, brand, and type**.

Finally, I enhanced the **pagination system**, making it clearer by displaying the **total number of available vehicles, current page, and items per page**.
